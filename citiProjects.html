                        Worked with Citi's Capital markets business unit, as a UX Engineer/technology analyst focused on front end
                        design and development. The goal was to develop a dashboard which would consolidate 5 screen
                        functionalities into a single one. I was involved in the designing, development and user
                        research processes. Maximum work was development in Typescript.
